    This posting is part of a series which comprises the IPR analysis, see <a href="#references">previous postings</a> for more on this.
</p>
<p>
In this posting, I examine the effect on &alpha; and $\siga$ due to the fact that we didn't measure the pol angles for all detector pairs used in B18. In addition to increased noise from simply having fewer detectors on-sky, we are also worried about how well the standard B18 purification matrix will work on a map with reduced coverage. Fortunately, I find that the matrix purification shows an increase in $\siga$ by only 3-5% for maps with reduced coverages. We do, however, see an increase in $\siga$ of 30% resulting from increased noise due to having less detectors. I find that if we include higher &ell;-bins, we might be able to counter this effect though.

    <h2>Purification of B18 with fewer detectors</h2>
    <p>
        Making purification matrices is a really involved process so we'd rather not have to remake them for this analysis. Instead, we're hoping to reuse the purification matrix created for the BICEP3 3-year dataset (AKA B18) that was used in BK18.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this analysis, we will only be using detector pairs for which we have high-quality measurements from the RPS. This means we have only ~70% of the the detector pairs that were used in any of the given years comprising B18. Because fewer detectors means less coverage, we can expect a hit to the efficiency of the matrix purification in the maps which only contain detectors with RPS-derived pol angles.
    </p>

            Table of the number of detector pairs that were used in the full-year coadded maps for a given year compared to the number of those detectors for which we also have good RPS-derived angles. The number of detectors was acquired from the <tt>coaddopt.ind.rgla</tt> variable in each year's full-year coadded map file.

    <p>
        I check the impact on the purification efficiency by comparing two B18 simsets of 10 realizations, one with maps comprising all detectors used in B18 (sernum 6600, B18-rerun) and another with only detectors that also have RPS-derived angles (sernum 6622, B18-rerun-subset).
        The plot below compares the spectra of the two simsets.</p>
    <p>Some notes:
        <ul>
    <li>Each bandpower in the plot is the average over the 10 realizations. Both simsets use realization indices of 1-10 so, because we use seeded realizations, the spectra would be identical if using less detectors had no effect.</li>
    <li>I show both the spectra themselves and the fractional difference between the two. For the frac-diff plots, I limit the y-axis &pm;1 where needed as large deviations beyond 1 are due to a small number being divided by another small number.</li>
    <li>As with my recent previous postings, I cross Type 8 (Lensed Signal+Noise+Dust) T/E/B with a given signal's T/E/B.
        This is useful because it gives meaning to EB/TB angle fits for noise and dust signal types. For instance, we know that $\sigasq$ scales linearly with BB-power with signals crossed with CMB so we can predict a priori through the spectra how $\siga$ will be affected by this reduction in coverage or any inefficiencies in purification. All other signals are crossed with type 8 to make the spectra comparable in an absolute sense.</li>
</ul>

    <p>
    Differences in TT, TE, and EE due to coverage are on the percent level for the most part -- perhaps not too surprising. When we matrix purify, we don't see any change to TE, or EE because we don't bother adding E lost to E&rightarrow;B leakage back into E, I think. </p>
    <p>
        Focusing primarily on BB then:

    <ul>
    <li><b>Unlensed-LCDM:</b>Differences in coverage mostly affect the three lowest &ell;-bins, which I think makes intuitive sense. Lower coverage translates into a higher sample variance and the lower &ell;'s are most affected by that. When we matrix-purify, matrix purification is qualitatively still effective and most of the large deviations in the frac-diff are due to dividing a small number by another small number.</li>
    <li><b>Lensed-LCDM:</b> The comment about coverage is the same as before. However, now that we have a high-SNR measurement of lensing, the difference between purified spectra is only 3% or so, which tells us that the purification matrix isn't running into any issues with the reduced detectors or coverage.</li>
    <li><b>Noise:</b> Whether we're purifying or not, we can see the BB-power has increased on the order of 30%. No surprise there -- we've dropped the number of detectors we're using by 30% and the noise BB power is going to reflect that. I don't know that BB-power and N-detectors are known to be strongly linked -- I'd expect pair coverages/weights to obfuscate that relationship a bit -- so the fact that both are ~30% is interesting.</li>
    <li><b>L-LCDM+Noise(+Dust):</b> we're noise-dominated in BB at high-&ell;, so we see that 30% increase in BB-power where noise is dominant. At lower &ell;, the noise isn't as dominant over the lensing signal and the contribution to dust is more profound as well, so while we see an increase in BB, it's only 10-20% at those lower &ell; for both type 7 and 8.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

    <p>In summary, we can see through Lensed-signal only that the purification efficiency for maps with our reduced coverage is around 97%, so we should be good to continue using the B18 purification matrix so long as the angles aren't biased in any way.</p>

    <h3>How does this affect our angle fits?</h3>
    <p>
        The table below shows a comparison of the angle uncertainties between our two simsets.
        In one of my previous postings, I showed that we could decrease $\siga$ by ~30% by increasing bandpowers over which we fit from 2-10 to 2-15, so I include a column for both fits over bins 2-10 and 2-15. In either case, we do see a ~50% increase in $\siga$. Incidentally, the effect of including more bandpowers roughly cancels-out the effect of using less detectors, providing an even stronger motivation to look into this.

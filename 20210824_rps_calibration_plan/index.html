<p> RPS (Rotating Polarised Source) observations are used to characterise individual detector properties,
  namely efficiency and polarisation angle. The knowledge of the exact polarisation angle of
  each detector is not necessary for standard B-modes analysis. However, we need to know it with a very 
  high precision if we want to be able to constraint isotropic cosmic birefringence, since the global
  polarisation angle of the instrument is degenerate with the cosmic birefrigence angle. While some 
  methods have been proposed where the measurement of the instrument polarisation angle is not needed, 
  we believe that the precise characterisation of individual detector polarisation angles
  to obtain the global instrument polarisation angle is the best way towards measuring or improving upper limits 
  on the cosmic birefringence angle. <br> <br>

  To do so, we have analysed RPS data taken in 2017 and 2018 to derive individual detector polarisation angles.
  We have developped techniques to constrain these angles with the best possible precision given the data we 
  currently have, but the precision of these results could be significantly improved by taking new data.
  <br><br>
  
  In this posting, we first summarise previous work, and then propose an RPS calibration plan for the coming austral 
  summer, building on the experience we have gained - both in terms of field calibration and data analysis - to optimise 
  the measurement campaign and make sure we have the best possible measurements.

  <h3 id=previous>Previous data and work</h3>
  <p>
    RPS measurements for BICEP3 were taken in January 2017 and 2018, with the mirror installed. To derive individual 
    detector polarisation angles, it is crucial to first build a reliable pointing model that includes the mirror,
    and to know the source and mirror position with respect to the telescope with a very good precision. While working
    on RPS data analysis, we made some changes in the Beam Map Pointing Model (BMPM) which used to analyse RPS data, as 
    presented in <a href=http://bicep.rc.fas.harvard.edu/bkcmb/analysis_logbook/analysis/20210518_bmpm/> this posting</a>. <br><br>

    To determine the position of the mirror and the source, the best way to proceed is to first observe the Moon with
    the mirror on, allowing to determine first the mirror position, and then the source. However, no Moon observations
    with the mirror on were taken in 2017. It is still possible to determine the source and mirror position by using data taken 
    in 2017, but the derived positions suffer from higher uncertainties. In his <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05934.pdf>SPIE paper</a>, 
    James presented the results he obtained using RPS data taken in January 2018 - polarisation angles and efficiency for
    800 detector pairs. <br><br>

    We have since then re-analysed the same data set (January 2018) with a different method to estimate source and mirror positions.
    In this updated method, we estimate beam parameters in raw mount coordinates (before applying any pointing model), and then
    estimate source and mirror positions. To do so, we minimise the difference between beam coordinates derived from  RPS observation 
    using the (updated) BMPM to, and "canonical" beam parameters from CMB observations. This work is summarised in various postings:

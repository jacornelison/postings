<p>
    During the 2021/2022 Austral Summer, we observed the moon to supplement the RPS and CMB data the was taken with the
    calibration mirror, aka Far Field Flat (FFFlat). This posting covers the analysis of that data and presents the
    best-fit mirror orientation with uncertainties. We also discuss an analysis of the systematics in detail.
</p>

<!---------------->
<section><h2>Observations</h2>

    <p>The Moon observations this year were nearly identical to the RPS observations: each observation covered one-third
        of the focal plane and consisted of 19 9&deg;Az-by-2&deg;El scans stepping in 1.5&deg; increments per scan from
        -14&deg;El to 12.5&deg;El.
        The only difference between these observations and RPS observations is that we only scanned over the Moon once
        per elevation step. With these schedules, we were able to cover the entire focal plane at a single DK angle in
        about 3 hours.</p>

            color represents a scan within a given schedule.

    </figure>

    <h3>Data Sets</h3>
    <p>We did two Moon observing runs. One from 30 Nov 2021 to 10 Dec 2021 and another over 25/26 Jan 2022. You can find
        details about the observations here: <a href="2022_moon_obs"></a>.</p>

<section><h2>Analysis</h2>

    <p>We fit beams per-detector per-scan in raw mount coordinates $\left(A_0,\,E_0\right)$ <a href="KWY2007"></a>
        before fitting for the mirror parameters. The DK-angle isn't used for finding the beam, but we need it for
        converting to focal plane coordinates, so the DK-at-beam-center is determined by 2D-interpolating the raw DK
        coordinate timestream vs Az and EL at the as-fit beam center. The same process is applied to determining the
        Moon's location at the beam center by interpolating the Moon's Az and El from the <tt>antenna0.tracker.horiz_topo</tt>
        GCP register.</p>

        <img src="figs/mirror_coords2.png">
        <figcaption>
            Diagram of the mirror geometry. The mirror orientation is parameterized by the $Tilt$ and $Roll$ parameters.
            $\hat{n}$ is the mirror normal, $\overrightarrow{A}$ is the aperture position and $\overrightarrow{A}'$ is
            the apparant aperature position from the mirror's reflection.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We then fit for the mirror's Tilt and Roll parameters (Fig. 2.1) using <tt>beam_map_pointing_model.m</tt> as our
        model:</p>

    \begin{equation}
    [x,\,y,\,\phi] = \text{beam_map_pointing_model}(Tilt,\,Roll | A_{0},\,E_{0},\,K_{0},\,Mount,\,Moon)
    \end{equation}

    where $A_0$, $E_0$, and $D_0$ are the as-fit beam centers in raw mount coordinates; $Mount$ comprises the relevant
    mount information derived from both optical starpointing and Solidworks drawings; $Moon$ comprises the on-sky
    position of the moon in topocentric horizontal coordinates.

    <p>Then using CMB-derived beam centers as the 'observed' quantity, the chi-square to minimize is just:</p>

    \begin{equation}
    \chi^2=\sum \frac{(x_{CMB,i}-x_{0,i})^2+(y_{CMB,i}-y_{0,i})^2}{\sigma_i^2}
    \end{equation}

    <p>
        We use our standard $MINUIT$ wrapper, <tt>matmin.m</tt>, using <tt>chisq.m</tt> as our GOF calculator. We
        normalize the errors returned by <tt>matmin</tt> using the largest statistical uncertainty of the beam centers
        of $\sigma=0.01^\circ$ which were derived by comparing moon observations at the same DK angle taken back-to-back
        (see &sect;4.1 for more details).

    <h2>Systematics</h2>

    <b>A quick note on derotating beam center residuals</b>

    <p>The instrument-fixed coordinate system includes rotations in DK which can obfuscate phenomena intrinsic to
        the geometry of the mirror. To migitate this, we can subtract out the DK angle by converting the residuals
        from $x/y$ to $r/\theta$ and reconverting to $x/y$ using $r$ and $\theta-DK$. This displays the residuals in
        a quasi-mirrored-fixed where the Tilt is along the Y axis and the Roll is along the X axis. Figure 4.1 shows
        an example of the beam center residuals as a function of mirror tilt and roll in both boresight-centered and
        'mirror-centered' space.
    </p>

                    return 'figs/derot_demo_T_' + params.tilt + '_R_' + params.roll + '_' + params.derot + '.png';

    <p>
        With that in mind, the figure below shows the best-fit beam center residuals with an without derotation.
        With the derotation on, we see that the Y-axis is roughly Gaussian with $\sigma\sim0.05^\circ$ but the
        X-axis has two peaks equally spaced around zero by $\sim0.025^\circ$.

        The left plot of Figure 4.3 shows the derotated X-residuals as a function of the boresight's azimuthal
        offset from the Moon's azimuth. The right plot similarly shows the elevation offset from the Moon's
        elevation. Finally, we scale the color of the plots in time. These plots are useful for identifying trends
        across the entire mirror in the roll and tilt axes respectively.

    <p>
        There are a couple major stand-outs from these plots:
    <ul>
        <li>X-res vs. Az</li>
        <ul>
            <li>There's a major shift of ~0.05&deg; between the Early December and Late January data.</li>
            <li>A slight negative trend can be seen as a function of azimuth, independent of time.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Y-res vs. El</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The very early December data shows a slight negative trend, but this goes away by the following
                week.
            </li>
            <li>The behavior of the residuals is roughly consistent (at least much moreso than the X-residuals vs.
                Az) between the early December and late January data.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The negative trends in X vs. Az and (early) Y Vs. El could be physically explained by a uniform bowing in
        the mirror along the roll and tilt axis respectively, but more investigation would be needed. Why the
        tilt-axis would flatten out over the span of a week and then stay that way is unclear.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the context of the RPS analysis that I'm doing, the shift in Roll is by far the most important as a bias
        in $\phi$ scales almost 1:1 with a bias in Roll. As such, I spend the rest of this posting addressing where
        this shift originates from. Still there are the questions regarding the other points that could be answered
        with more effort...
    </p>

    <h3>Timing</h3>

    <p>From figure 4.3 the bi-modality in the roll axis is caused by a change of something over time. So then I
        compared the residuals that were taken at the same DK angle at varying time scales. In the December dataset
        we had selected a couple of DK angles at which to run back-to-back so the minimum spacing we have is on
        ~1-hour timescales. Unfortunately, I missed the late-December window to observe the moon, so we only have
        spacing of 1 hour, 1 week, and 2 months.</p>

    <p>The short-timescale plots show us that the intrinsic measurement uncertainty on the beam centers is quite
        good with the statistical uncertainty on the beam centers being 15arcsec and 43arcsec along the Roll and
        Tilt axes respectively<sup>[<a name="sup1" href="#ftn1">1</a>]</sup>.</p>

    <p>
        In the 'Long' timescale plots, we see a definitive shift of ~3arcmin which suggests that the mirror tilt
        shifted over time. However, given the issues we've been seeing in GPS timing and CMB data, I took a closer
        look at the actual timestreams (Fig 4.5).
    </p>


    <p>
        Both Elevation and Azimuth only update every 1 second by $7\times{10^{-5}}^\circ$ / $4\times{10^{-3}}^\circ$
        which is in agreement with what I calculate for the difference in El and Az to be over 1 second using the
        JPL Horizons database. However, there's another jump in Elevation that occurs at 60-second intervals and are
        $O\left(-10^{-4}\right)$.

    <p>I was worried that the moon's position as given by GCP might not be
        reliable, so I compared this position to the position (Az/El) given by the JPL Horizons database.
        Over the course of the whole campaign, the difference in elevation is small and appears to differ as a
        function of the elevation of the moon itself. The difference in Azimuth however continues to grow over time,
        which could lend itself to the idea that we're somehow drifting from the moon's actual location.

    <p>
        I don't think this is what's actually happening because we would see a similarly large shift in the tilt
        between the data from December and that of January. In the table below, I show the fits for the mirror tilt
        for the first moon dataset and the second separately as well as with the GCP moon position and Horizons moon
        position. If the Horizons position was the real position, then we would expect the tilts from December and
        January data to be the same and the effective difference in Azimuth for a given position from the
        GCP-source-derived tilts to be ~0.16 degrees. However, neither of these are true.

    <b>Takeaway's here:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Mirror measurements are pretty consistent on short (1hr/1wk) timescales.</li>
        <li>There's a measurable shift in roll of ~0.05&deg; between the early Dec and Late Jan Moon obs.</li>
        <li>The shape and scatter of the of the residuals is consistent between months. This implies that the
            overall roll shifted but the mirror stayed the same shape (along the roll axis).
        </li>
        <li>The tilt is the exact opposite: There's no discernible shift in tilt, but the scatter is consistently
            lower in the January compared to December implying that the mirror deformed slightly in tilt (for the
            better)
        </li>
        <li>Unlikely to be caused by timing issues in GCP.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        So it's still not clear why there's a difference in the roll -- it very well could have physically shifted
        over time -- but I believe I've ruled out timing issues as the culprit. In order to start looking at the RPS
        data taken over January, I fit the mirror parameters for the two different datasets and assuming that the
        real mirror position is halfway between the two and select half of the difference between the best fit
        parameters of the Dec and Jan data as my systematic uncertainty.

    <h3>Residual Quiver Plots Fit Per-Obs</h3>
    <p>
        The last plot I wanted to look at was quiver plots of the residuals fit per-DK. As we saw in Figure 3.1, the roll parameter also has the effect of twisting the residuals and this effect increases as you get farther away from the true roll. Quiver plots are quite good at showing us this effect. A spiral pattern in the residuals tells us that even though we've converged, there's something still off about our best-fit roll parameter. Using the best-fit roll over all datasets would show a twist in all of the data, so I show the quivers for each observation where the tilt and roll parameters have been fit for each.

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>A significant part of the model that I had not considered so far is the phase of the moon which, due to the
        uneven brightness temperature of the surface can affect the apparent location. <a href="Xu2019"></a> discuss
    how this was addressed with the CLASS experiment and seems like a good starting point.

    <h3>Effect of wind on the mirror</h3>
    <p>
        I was also interested in what sort of effect the wind had on our measurements. Especially in the context of
        BICEP Array and future experiments where the mirrors are larger, how the wind affects our calibrations is
        going to become more and more of an issue. Fortunately, there's no evidence in the data that the wind plays a
        large role just yet.

    <h3>Extra Troubleshooting Pager</h3>

    <p>The pager below shows a multitude of different parameters that I used to help try and identify potential
        sources of systematics.
        For the most part, everything looks fine. The most notable clicks are one in the Tilt axis are displayed as
        a function of time: <a href="javascript:pager.setparams({'rot': '_derot','r': 'x','t': 't_cen'})">X vs. Obs
            Time</a> and <a href="javascript:pager.setparams({'rot': '_derot','r': 'x','t': 'schind'})">X Vs.
            Schedule #</a>.

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div class="footnote">
        <p>
            <sup>[<a name="ftn1" href="#sup1">1</a>]</sup>
            I calculate the statistical uncertainty by subtracting the best-fit beam centers of detectors between two
            datasets at the same DK, taking the standard deviation, and then dividing that by $\sqrt{2}$ to account for
            the drop in N by 2 when subtracting.

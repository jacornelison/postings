    <p>
        The In-Situ Absolute Angle Checker (ISAAC) is a room-temperature, 90GHz receiver with a polarizing wire grid. The ISAAC would be placed on DSL along the BICEP-to-RPS line of site with the idea that it, having no moving parts, can serve as a sort of "control subject" receiver that possesses well known polarization properties, has precisely calibrated polarization orientation (WRT to gravity), and observes the RPS during normal observations. In the lab, the ISAAC can also serve as a supplementary cross-check of the RPS's wire grid orientation and motor rotational repeatability, both of which we normally calibrate using the Bridgeport knee mill in MAPO.
    </p>
</section>


<section><h2>Baseline</h2>
    <p>
        We set the ISAAC receiver (sans wire grid) ~1m away from the RPS with the RPS unattenuated and chopping at 20Hz. We then
        collected mock rastersets where the RPS rotated through 360 degrees (-180&deg; to 180&deg; in 30&deg;
        increments), resting for 150 seconds at each angle. The ISAAC itself was exposed to ambient air and <i>not</i> under temperature control. While it was placed on the same table, the table was wooden and seemed to deform in unpredicable (but measureable) ways when people walked near it.
        The ISAAC output was read out by an SRS lock-in amp, the
        X and Y channels of which where digitally recorded by a LabJack.
    </p>

        </figcaption>

    </figure>
    <p>Each mock rasterset takes ~30 minutes to complete, so the number of rastersets we could take was limited from time constraints. For the first 10 datasets, we homed the RPS between the mock rasters and for the following 20 or so, we only
        homed before the first raster. The homing repeatability is worse than the bi-directional repeatability (0.06&deg;
        vs 0.002&deg;), so the difference between the repeatability of angle estimates between the two groups of data should
        reflect this.</p>

                {
                    'Angle Estimations|h': ['Homing|homing','No Homing|nohoming'],
                },
                function(params) {
                    return 'figs/isaac_angle_hist_0dB_'+params.h+'.png';

    </figure>

    <p>
        The standard deviation of the angle estimates of the two groups are 0.08&deg; and 0.02&deg; for homing and no-homing respectively. For the homing rastersets, we're close to expected considering the low sample size. For the non-homing rastersets, we're expectedly lower but only by a factor of 3 instead of 30. Considering that the ISAAC wasn't under thermal feedback, nor secured to a particularly rigid surface, we're not particularly surprised we didn't get down to arcsecond-level repeatability.
    </p>

</section>

<section><h2>Repeatability VS SNR</h2>
    <p>Next we examined how the repeatability was affected by the SNR of the measurements. The final position of the ISAAC would be at DSL (~200m) which is too far to do in-lab, so we simulated this by attenuating the RPS instead. In addition, we typically attenuate the RPS by 10dB to prevent the detectors from saturating during observations. So in total, we estimate the effective observing amplitude to be ~-55dB, -45dB to account for the inverse square law and another 10 to account for the detectors. For this test, we first attenuated to 30dB, 45dB, and then to 55dB. We picked only three points because we were limited by time. The figure below shows the standard deviations on the angle estimations as a function of attenuation.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="figs/plot_est_vs_att.png">

        </figcaption>

    </figure>
    <p>
        The results aren't exactly promising. While the uncertainty is unchanged from 0db to 30db attenuation, the uncertainty increases by an order of magnitude going to 45dB. At 55dB, the angle is practically undetectable.</p>
    <p>
        The are some important aspects of this benchtop measurement that differ from our expectation of the outdoor measurements that should improve our constraining power.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The gain of both the LNA and detector are expected to increase as they get colder out of doors by at least 3dB each.
        <li>The ISAAC wasn't under thermal control and it was difficult to align properly on the fold-out table upon which is was placed.
        <li>I expect the noise floor will be lower outside since we won't be surrounded by noisy electronics and a bunch of reflective metal surfaces.
    </ol>
    <p>
        Whether or not the combination of these differences fixes things is still to be determined.  At worst, I've found that it serves as an excellent cross-check of the wire grid calibration that we do on the Bridgeport knee mill, so the current plan is to continue setting up the angle checker for outdoor measurements.
    </p>

    <h2>ISAAC as a wire grid calibration cross-check</h2>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The ISAAC was instrumental in discovering and fixing a critical flaw in the homing switch of the RPS's rotation stage. We spent pretty much the entire month of December 2021 characterizing this issue and fabricating an additional 'fine' homing switch.</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Our first set of indoor benchtop tests appear to show that measurements of the RPS grid angle using the ISAAC compare nicely to the measurements from counting wires on a knee mill (Fig. 4.2).</li>
        <li>The indoor results hint that something might be be wrong with the homing, but were within our 0.1&deg; uncertainty threshold so we moved on.</li>
        <li>Our first set of outdoor tests using the ISAAC show a significant degradation in the homing precision of the RPS.</li>
        <li>Quick observations with BICEP3 over a known good detector pair were relatively lower SNR, but appear to confirm the ISAAC results.</li>
        <li>After adding a 'fine' homing switch to the RPS, the indoor and outdoor tests with the ISAAC show consistent, high-precision homing.</li>
    </ul>



    <h3>First Indoor Tests</h3>

    <p>
        After installing and calibrating the wire grids in the Bridgeport, I set the RPS and ISAAC on a benchtop for indoor measurements. For these measurements, I rotated from -180&deg; to 180&deg; in 30&deg;. Because we were still building the parts for it, the ISAAC was not under thermal feedback control nor did we have continuous tilt monitoring. Instead, I placed a Starrett No 98 level on top the ISAAC grid holder and occasionally stopped by to ensure that it was still level.
    </p>

    <h3>First Outdoor Tests</h3>
    <p>The outdoor tests were conducted the same way as the indoor tests except that the ISAAC was temperature controlled to within <1&deg;; the ISAAC tilt meter was operating and recorded; and the 360-degree rotations were completed in 15&deg; increments instead of 30&deg;.</p>

    <h4>Pager Descriptions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>No Homing 1: Both the RPS and ISAAC were placed on wooden boxes and spaced ~2m away from each other.</li>
        <li>No Homing 2: Seeing the strange distribution of angle estimates, I took another round of data to confirm.</li>
        <li>No Homing 3: I took both the RPS and ISAAC off of the wooden boxes and placed them on the hatch above the MAPO control room so that I could align them better.</li>
        <li>Relevel: When first I put them on the hatch, I only leveled them to within one or two ticks of the Starrett 98 level. After seeing ~0.3&deg; shift, I releveled both the RPS and ISAAC to <1 tick to verify that the tilt meters weren't the issue.</li>
        <li>Grid Check: I brought the ISAAC inside, removed the grid holder (grid still installed) and checked the grid alignment in the Bridgeport mill. I confirmed that the grid horizontal was the same as when I first installed it. I then reassembled the ISAAC and placed it back on the roof for more measurements (level was <1 tick).</li>
        <li>Homed Once: After seeing another huge shift in mean angle, I decided to home the RPS. I did not change anything about the setup between the RPS and ISAAC.</li>
        <li>With Homing: Seeing the mean angle return to something reasonable, I decided to take more measurements except with homing after each 360-degree rotation.</li>
    </ol>

        <figcaption>
            Angle estimates for the outside tests shows high repeatability but with large offsets that are inconsistent with the expected repeatability of the RPS motor. The difference between the 'Grid Check' and Homed Once' histograms shows strong evidence that the ISAAC is accurately measuring the motor behaving abnormally.

    <h3>Tests with BICEP3</h3>
    <p>
        From the tests above, I had the suspicion that the ISAAC was doing its job and there was something perhaps wrong with the RPS, but to verify, I placed the RPS on the mast and took similar measurments using BICEP3. For these tests, I aligned a detector pair close to the boresight (MCE1 GCP:35 & 36) and had the RPS rotate from -180&deg; to 180&deg; in 30&deg; increments.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>With Homing: I ran a schedule of 24 rotations with homing between each. The ~0.4&deg; distribution was larger than any of the outdoor tests, indicating that the we're dominated by the noise of the observation.</li>
        <li>Reseated Connector: Just in case, I lowered the RPS to inspect the motor and cabling for interference or loose connections. I found that the stack of gender changers which serve as bulkhead connectors going to the motor were not correctly installed (<a href="figs/20211213_122900.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>). So I properally connected everything, raised and leveled the mast and ran another schedule. </li>
        <li>No Homing: The scatter of angle estimates seemed to lower, so I ran a schedule without homing. The scatter lowered as expected.</li>
        <li>No Homing 2: I ran another set of 24 schedules for redundancy, but accidently homed the RPS before running. The results of this measurement are unexpected because the scatter increases by a factor of two and look somewhat comparable to the 'No homing 1&2' histograms from the outdoor ISAAC tests.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Post-Fix Measurements</h3>
    <p>Using the information from the ISAAC, we were eventually able to determine that the culprit</p>
    <p>The indoor tests were conducted in the same manner as before except now the ISAAC was completely assembled and under thermal feedback to help with stability.</p>

    <h3>RPS Test Schedules</h3>
    This year, we included a test schedule, <tt>8_ffflat_rps_09_dk000_xxx.sch</tt> (called Type 9's), which map beams for a single known good detector pair at the center of the focal plane (Tile 11 Row 4 Col 5). The type-9's are run between each science RPS schedule to allow for quick-turnaround analysis and thus monitoring of the RPS's rotation stage. Throughout the campaign, I lowered, raised, and releveled the mast on several occasions. I once even purposely tilted the mast off-level to verify the tilt meter calibration. Over the entire month of calibrations, the STD of derived polarization angles for these schedules was $\sigma_\phi<0.09^\circ$.

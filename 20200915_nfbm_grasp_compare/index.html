<p>In a previous posting, I provided a preliminary analysis of beam steer estimates. In this posting, I examine beam steer in both GRASP simulations and real data. Comparing estimates on the GRASP sims from my metrics analysis pipeline to known input values of beam steer, I find that beam steer is consistently underestimated by ~20% across the focal plane. In later analyses, I aim to find the cause of this but for now I choose instead to simply scale the estimates on real data by this factor.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, I investigate a possible source of bias in beam steer resulting from parallax effects unaccounted for during out coordinate transformation. Using a raytracing scheme in Zemax validated by a summer student, we find a bias on beam steer due to near-field parallax to be $\Delta \theta_{bs}<0.04^\circ$.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, I present results of beams steer on real BICEP3 data taken at Pole in January of 2017. I find that current levels of beam steer are a full order of magnitude lower than the levels measured on the old Keck 150 FPU's.

<h2>Grasp Sims</h2>

    The following GRASP sims have been converted and run through the metrics analysis pipeline. The pager below shows maps of the GRASP sims, downsampled to match the same pixel spacing as the BICEP3 Jan 2017 data (~14mm/pix).

    <p>It should be immediately obvious that the $\pm3^\circ$ beam steer maps are identical. This is because the data for these on the Google Drive are also identical. I've contacted Paul about rectifying this.</p>

    <h2>Beam Steer</h2>

    <h3>Converting Beam Steer from mm to degrees</h3>
    <p>In a previous posting, I defined the beam steer as a lateral offset between the beam center and aperture center ($r_{beam}-r_{apt}$) in NFBMs and offered previous results in units of mm. In practice, beam steer is more easily comparable to sims when converted from that lateral offset into an equivalent offset angle, $\theta_{bs}$, of the beam trajectory WRT to the focal plane normal. This is computed by using the ratio of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_aperture">angular apterture</a>, $a$, to the aperture radius, $D/2$</p>
    \begin{equation}
    \theta_{bs} = \frac{2a}{D}\left(r_{beam}-r_{apt}\right)
    \end{equation}
    <p>
        And $a$ can be substituted for the effective f-number, $N_f$:
    </p>

    \begin{equation}
    \theta_{bs} =\frac{2}{D_{apt}}\tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{1}{2\cdot\,N_f}\right)}\left(r_{beam}-r_{apt}\right)
    \end{equation}
    <p>Where, for BICEP3, $N_f=1.576$ and $D_{apt}=520\,\text{mm}$:</p>

    \begin{equation}
    \theta_{bs} = \frac{17.60^\circ}{260\,\text{mm}}\left(r_{beam}-r_{apt}\right)
    \end{equation}
    <p>Realistically, the $N_f$ varies across the focal plane, but I've verified through Zemax that using the "working" $N_f$ is approximately good to within 4% across the whole focal plane.</p>



    <h3>Near-Field Corrections to the Aperture Function</h3>
    <p>We use a plate scale function to calculate the apparent aperture centers for each detector based on their on-sky pointing ($r,\,\theta$):

        \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
        &x_{apt} = -d \tan(r)\cos(\theta+\phi)+x_{0}\\
        &y_{apt} = d \tan(r)\sin(\theta+\phi)+y_{0}
        \end{split}
        \end{equation}

        and we had some intuition that this could be slightly non-linear in the near field due to parallax. To check this, the idea was to determine the physical x-y positions chief rays coming off the focal plane in the plane of the near field beam mapper using Zemax and then compare those values to those calculated by our plate-scale function using the same distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        To verify that our model (and method) was correct, we first needed to verify that we could correctly calculate far-field pointing before moving on to the near field. We had a summer student (Kaylah McGowan from UofA) re-blaze the trail for converting detector locations on the focal plane ($R_{FP}$) into on-sky pointing ($r_{SKY}$) at the far field via Zemax models (see <a href="JBW2016"></a> for previous work).</p>
    <p>In essence, her recipe was as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For a given model, create a dummy lens object at the very end of the lens system in "lens data".</li>
        <li>Set the dummy lens object thickness to very far away (we set ours arbitrarily to 5e6 mm)</li>
        <li>Using the "single raytrace" tool, record the z-cosine value after the dummy lens object for a series of distances on the focal plane (normalized in OptStudio from 0 to 1 for FP center and edge respectively).</li>
        <li>Convert FP distances from normalized to mm and ray angles to degrees (using arccos) to produce an array of $R_{FP}$ vs. $r_{SKY}$.</li>
        <li>Fit a 4th-order polynomial (with no constant) to the $R_{FP}$ vs. $r_{SKY}$ data to produce a function which converts radial distance on the focal plane to on-sky pointing WRT to boresight.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Her results for a far-field case compared to those from JWB's posting are shown below. We find that Kaylah's results deviate, at most, on the order of 1 arcmin compared to JWB's, which we think are sufficiently close for our purposes.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="figs/zemax_reanalysis.png"/>
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>

    </figure>


    <p>Thanks to Kaylah, I was able to take this project one step further and calculate $r_{SKY}$ for the near-field case to see if we can detect significant deviations in pointing in the near field which would skew our beam steer results. I followed her recipe as described above but instead set the dummy lens object thickness to 366mm to match the near field mapper distance of 508mm (20 inches) from the aperture set in Paul's GRASP sims. For convenience, I wrapped steps 3 and 4 in her procedure in a Zemax macro: <a href="scripts/rfpu_to_rsky.ZPL">rfpu_to_rsky.ZPL</a></p>
    <p>In the plot below, I compare the near-field results to the Kaylah's far-field results. We can see that the near-field pointing is nearly identical, deviating at most by ~2 arcseconds.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="figs/zemax_nearfield_correction.png"/>
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        I then computed the positions at which the rays intersect the mapper plane $R_{apt}$ (using <a href="scripts/rfpu_to_rsky.ZPL">rfpu_to_rsky.ZPL</a>) and compared them to the positions calculated by the plate scale function assuming $x_0=y_0=\phi=0$ and $d=508\,\text{mm}$. Because the plate scale function uses $r,\,\theta$ as inputs instead of $R_{FPU}$, I used the near-field 4th-order polynomial function described above to convert $R_{FPU}$ to $r_{SKY}$ before computing $R_{apt}$. Results from Zemax and the plate scale function are plotted below along with their residuals.

    </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="figs/beam_steer_bias.png"/>
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        In the plot above, we can clearly see that higher order effects cause deviations in the residuals up to $\sim0.6\,\text{mm}$ at the edge of the focal plane which amounts to $<0.05^\circ$ bias on beam steer.
    </p>




    <h3>Beam Steer in GRASP sims</h3>
<p>
    Like real data, I calculate aperture center on each map (see $\S 4$ of <a href="JAC2020B"></a>) to center the maps before calculating beam steer. For the sims, I assume zero $x$, $y$, or $\phi$ correction and set the mapper distance to 508mm (20") to reflect the mapping plane set in the sims. After centering the maps, I estimate the beam centers using a 4-parameter cylindrically symmetric gaussian -- $\left[A\,\,x_0\,\,y_0\,\,\sigma\right]$. Additionally, to avoid errors on the fit from deformation at the aperture edge, I zero-weighted all data outside a diameter of 385mm. Cacluating the beam steer is trivial as, since the maps are already centered, the beam steer is simply equal to the estimates on the beam centers.
</p>

    </figure>
<p>
    We can see from the plot above that the beam steer estimates become less reliable as the beam steer increases. The plot below shows this more quantitatively where the estimates of beam steer are ~80% of the input quantities.

    <p>
        In a later posting, I plan to mitigate the bias here but for now I'll move on and simply <b>scale the results on the real data by 1.2</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Beam Steer on BICEP3 2017 data</h3>
    <p>
        I ran the BICEP3 Jan 2017 data through the same pipeline as the GRASP sims and scaled the results by a factor of 1.2 as discussed above. Figure 2.6 shows those results in a quiver plot. Note that for this particular dataset, MCE0 was not working (for reasons unknown to me) and so all MCE0 data has been cut.

        <b>Big Note:</b> in his 2012 SPIE proceedings <a href="ROB2012B"></a> Roger defines beam-steer phenomena in terms of "Horizontal" or "Vertical" corresponding an affect dominating in either the row or column part of the summing tree respectively. In our footnote 6 of our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.00596.pdf">Beams Paper</a> (footnote 23 in ApJ), we lock the "Horizontal" and "Vertical" directions as $y'$ and $x'$ respectively which caused some confusion for me as this is apparently backwards for BICEP3 at first glance (i.e. we see beam steer along the y-axis, thus Horizontal direction and corresponding to cross-talk and not Nb contamination). It turns out that if I instead follow the Horizontal-Vertical convention by tracking the rows and columns of the tiles (see figure 2.7), the beam steer is actually a gradient across the columns which is Vertical, as expected. Since tiles on MCE0 are clocked 90&deg; WRT to the other MCE's, I would expect that we would find that the beam steer followed the convention outlined in our Beams Paper. A look into the 2016 NFBM data which has MCE0 (but lower SNR) would be a good consistency check of this.
    </p>

        <figcaption>
            Tile plots for detector rows shows detector columns for MCE's 1 through 3 clocked 90&deg; WRT MCE0. Assuming MCE0 follows the convention layed out in footnote 6 of our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.00596.pdf">Beams Paper</a>, we can expect that our measured beams steer for these MCE's will be along the Y-direction since that is the "Vertical" direction for those MCE's.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>
    While the raw values of beam steer are muddled in the raw results, the tell-tale gradients can more easily be seen when I subtract the median values for each tile. From the pager above, we can also consistently see a sharp increase in the beam steer at the edge of the tiles. I acquire the per-tile gradients by fitting 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-order polynomials using the <code>polyfit.m</code> Matlab function and deriving the parameter uncertainties using bootstrapping. While adding the 2nd-order polynomial improves the fit, I don't see that the 3rd-order fit makes a meaningful difference for most cases.

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    These values can easily be compared to gradients calculated for Keck 150 tiles given in <a href="CLW2012C"></a> by multiplying them by $\frac{25.4\,mm}{in.}\frac{2a_{keck,150}}{D_{keck,150}}$. In her posting, Chin Lin finds for most Keck 150 tiles in 2012 $x^1>0.91^\circ/mm$ which is a full order of magnitude higher than the largest gradient measured on BICEP3. While this is expected, it is nice to finally see results showing how small this effect is compared the old tiles.

    </p>
<p>
    In <a href="ROB2012B"></a>, Roger finds that a simulating 5% gradient in $\lambda_{eff}$ was able to produce the level of beam steer measure by Chin Lin showing that it is possible to link contamination to beam steer metrics. The long-term goal is to see how these gradients directly result in T-to-P leakage and then in turn be able to, given some requirement for minimum T-to-P leakage, report real design tolerances for fabrication.

    <h2>Analysis Pipeline</h2>

    <h3>Data Reduction</h3>

    <p>Before I committed changes, the three functions below are a snapshot of the current (working) NFBM pipeline. The
        primary purposes of these functions is data reduction, mapmaking, and plotting for data quality
        respectively.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_makemap.m</code> - Loads raw detector timestream data from NFBM observations and deconvolves, demodulated, and bins them into maps at the per detector level.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_fitter.m</code> - Fits bivariate 2D Gaussians to binned maps.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_plotter.m</code> - Plots maps for data quality purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NFBM Metrics</h3>
    <p>
    The following code was written for the sole purpose of streamlining the measurement of arbitrary metrics in NFBMs. While we are currently only measuring beam steer and edge taper, the code is constructed in such a way that accomodating new metrics is easy. All parameter estimations are done through our Matlab wrapper for MINUIT called `matmin.m`.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_fit_metrics.m</code> - Wrapper function which measures metrics related to Near Field Beam Maps. Currently measures beam steer and edge taper.
        </li>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_fit_aperture.m</code> - Finds apparent aperture centers for channels by shifting and masking beams using four global parameters in conjunction with their on-sky pointing. See $\S\,4$ of <a href="JAC2020B"></a> for details.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>nfbm_get_apt_model.m</code> - 4-parameter + 1 nuisance parameter model that shifts and masks beams maps. For use by <code>matmin.m</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>nfbm_get_apt_center.m</code> - Given some location of the mapper center ($x_0,\,y_0$), mapper distance $d$, and mapper rotation $\phi$, returns the apparent aperture centers for all input channels of $r,\,\theta$.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_fit_beam.m</code> - Fits a 2D Gaussian beam to NFBMs of all selected channels.
        </li>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_get_apt_model.m</code> - Bivariate or cylindrically symmetric Gaussian model with optional masking ability.
        </li>

        </ul>
        <li>
            <code>nfbm_get_beam_steer.m</code> - Acquires beam steer for selected channels.

        <h3>Interfacing GRASP sims with the NFBM metrics pipeline</h3>
    <p>Grasp sims come in a standard format, so I've added some code that easily converts the numpy files into a Matlab
        struct that we can run through the NFBM analysis pipeline. Currently, the conversion from <code>.npz</code> to
        <code>.mat</code> is done via Python. I have preliminary matlab code that can do this as well, but the python
        handles this much better. If there's a strong demand to develop the matlab function for uniformity's sake, I can
        do that.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <code>npz_to_mat.py</code> - one-to-one conversion of GRASP <code>.npz</code> files into matlab compatible <code>.mat</code> structs. Requires <code>scipy</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>grasp2nfbmstruct.m</code> - Loads the raw GRASP sim data and outputs a struct identical to those taken by the NFBM pipeline including faux FPU parameters and channel flags using <code>get_grasp_array_info.m</code>.
        </li>
    </ol>
